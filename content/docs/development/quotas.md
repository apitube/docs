# Quotas

Each API plan is accompanied by a daily allocation of points. Every API call you make incurs a specific number of points. Typically, each request costs `1 point` if results available(if not it will cost `0 points`). At the top of each endpoint description, you'll discover details regarding the points required for that particular endpoint.

When you register you get free `3000 points`.

You can manage your quota entirely by monitoring your console dashboard.
